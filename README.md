# Arc Typora

## Intro

This is a typora theme using a color scheme from the Arc GTK theme for Linux. It is built to mimic LaTeX output (using the same fonts), and to match some of the styling of my personal notes.

Some of the style has been lifted from the [Academic](https://theme.typora.io/theme/Academic/) Typora theme.
